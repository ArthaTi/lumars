# Overview

Lumars is a high-level wrapper around LUA 5.1 that aims to be lightweight while providing high quality of life features.

For my GC-phobic friends, please read the [GC Phobia](#gc-phobia) section.

This library is in its early stages, so **expect bugs**. If you can be bothered, please open an issue alongside a minimised, idependent snippet of code
that I can add as a unittest, which will also make it easier for me to debug.
